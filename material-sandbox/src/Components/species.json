    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins including one adipose fin, dark mouth and gums, large oval black spots on tail and back (lake-run mostly silver), 13-17 rays in anal fins. Known in its native Pacific Northwest as the humpback salmon, this Pacific salmon was unintentionally introduced into the Great Lakes in the mid 1950s. The population has maintained itself since then, slowly growing in numbers and spreading to much of Lake Superior and Lakes Huron and Michigan. Pink salmon spawning runs begin in the summer in the Great Lakes. Females hollow out a nest in the gravel of a streambed by lying on one side and beating vigorously with their tails to remove silt and light gravel. The result is a deep trough with a raised rim of gravel at the downstream edge. Once they are fertilized, the eggs are covered. The female guards the nest as long as possible, but dies within a few days or weeks. Depending on water temperatures, eggs hatch from late December to late February, and the young remain in the gravel nest until late April or early May. Once they are mature enough to leave the nest, they journey downstream in large schools. After about 18 months in the lake the young pinks have reached adulthood and will begin their spawning cycle. Adult size for pink salmon is two to seven pounds and 17 to 19 inches in length. The average life span is two years, although some pink salmon have been known to live for three years. Great Lakes pink salmon eat a variety of fish and other aquatic animals. Young pinks, still in the stream, fall prey to trout, coho salmon, smelt, other predacious fish, fish-eating birds and some mammals. Great Lakes pink salmon are rarely caught by anglers; those that are taken are caught while ascending streams For more information on how and where to catch pink salmon see our  Michigan Fish and How to Catch Them and Better Fishing Waters.",

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins including one adipose fin, forked tail, barbels (whiskerlike sensory organ) around the mouth, slender body with speckled sides. The channel catfish and brown bullhead  are members of the Ictaluridae, or catfish family. These fish are readily distinguished by their scaleless bodies, broad flat heads, sharp heavy pectoral and dorsal spines, and long whisker-like barbels about the mouth. Members of the catfish family are all more or less omnivorous, feeding on all sorts of plant and animal matter. They are also mostly nocturnal, and use their barbels to locate food in the dark recesses of deep water. One of the most fascinating Great Lakes inhabitants is the channel catfish. This species of fish appears to have lived in North America for at least 3000 years. They are presently found in all the Great Lakes except Lake Superior. In the late spring or early summer, the male channel cat builds a nest in underwater holes, logs or among submerged rocks. The eggs hatch in 5-10 days following spawning, and the youngsters grow quite rapidly. Young catfish eat mostly insect, crayfish, other fish and even tree seeds. In turn, small catfish are probably eaten by many other fish. Sexual maturity comes at five to eight years of age, but these  fish live a great deal longer, some as long as 25 years. In the Great Lakes, this advanced age can be accompanied by a body size of 30 pounds.  At such a large size, adult channel cats probably have no predators except man. Channel cats prefer cooler, deeper, cleaner water than bullheads, and water with a sand or gravel bottom. During the day, they hide among rocks or logs. Channel cats feed both day and night, although they are best fished from dusk through early night. They take a large part of their food from the bottom, but they also feed at the surface. Their impressive size and high quality flesh make these catfish deservedly popular as a sport fish. They are also of significant commercial value, especially to fishermen of Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie.

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins including one adipose fin,  broad square tongue with 11-12 large teeth, light pectoral fins, square tail, 9-10 rays in the anal fin. Brown trout is something of a misnomer for many Great Lakes members of this species, since lake-run browns are predominately silver in color. In addition, the body spots, so characteristic of their stream-dwelling cousins, are often obscured in lake-dwellers. Brown trout are close relative of the Atlantic salmon, and also were brought to North American waters as exotics. These natives of Europe and western Asia were introduced into New York and Michigan waters in 1883. Brown trout have thrived in their new home, and have become firmly established in all of our upper Great Lakes waters. Lake dwelling brown trout are a wary lot. They hide in shallow water weed beds and rocky, boulder-strewn areas, and prefer a water temperature of 65-75 degrees F. Since brown trout spawn in tributary streams in September and October, they begin to take up residence near stream outlets in spring and early summer. After ascending a particular stream, brown trout spawners choose shallow, gravelly  or rocky areas. The female creates a shallow depression (redd) in the gravel, in which the spawning fish deposit the eggs and sperm. When the process is completed, the female covers the redd with gravel. The average lake run adult weighs 8 pounds, although  individuals can grow to be much larger. Young browns are preyed upon by larger fish and by predatory birds such as mergansers. The diet of adult brown trout includes insects and their larvae, crustaceans, mollusks, amphibians, small rodents and other fish. They enjoy a rather long life-span, it appears, since researchers have observed them at up to 13 years of age.

Brown bullheads, like channel catfish, also spawn in the late spring or early summer, in nests prepared in mud, sand, or among aquatic vegetation. These nests are usually located near a log or some other form of protection. One or both parents care for the eggs, since they must be diligently fanned and stirred. In a week or so, the eggs hatch and young emerge, looking very much like tadpoles. Their parents accompany them until they reach about two inches in length. Brown bullheads reach sexual maturity at three years of age, and their life span does not exceed six to eight years. The average adult brown bullhead is only eight to 14 inches long and weighs about 1 pound, although bullheads weighing six to eight pounds have been known to occur. Brown bullheads live in shallow bays, on or near a soft bottom with lots of vegetation. They are found as deep as 40 feet. They thrive in warm water, and can tolerate higher pollution and carbon dioxide levels, and lower oxygen levels than most other fish species. Brown bullheads are nocturnal bottom feeders. They consume algae, plants, mollusks, insects, fish eggs and fish, although they probably do not prey heavily on fish eggs. They do, of course, compete for food with other bottom-feeding fish. Bullheads, especially when young, are eaten by muskies, northern pike, walleyes, and other predatory fish. The public doesn't always hold brown bullheads in the highest regard, but nevertheless they have considerable market and recreation value. They are easy and fun to catch, and their flesh is delicious. It can be prepared in the kitchen in a number of ways, and is also good when smoked.

    "commonname": "Brook Trout",
    "latinname": "Salvelinus fontinalis",
    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Brook trout have a long, streamlined body with a large mouth that extends past the eye.  Color variations include olive, blue-gray, or black above with a silvery white belly and wormlike markings (vermiculations) along the back.  They have red spots sometimes surrounded by bluish halos on their sides.  The lower fins have a white front edge with black and the remainder being reddish orange.  The tail fin is square or rarely slightly forked.  During breeding time in the fall male brook trout can become very bright orange-red along the sides.  The brook trout is native to Michigan's waters and is the state fish of Michigan.  They can be found throughout most of the state in many creeks, streams, rivers, lakes, and in the Great Lakes.  Brook trout require cool, clear, spring-fed streams and pools.  They can be found under cover of rocks, logs, and undercut banks and have been described as stationary.  Larger brook trout often inhabit deep pools moving to shallow water only to feed.  They prefer temperatures from 57-60 degrees F.  Spawning generally occurs in the months of October and November.  Mature brook trout seek riffle areas with gravel in spring-fed streams, spring seepage areas of ponds, lake shores with swift currents, or lake bottoms where groundwater seepage occurs for spawning.  Female brook trout use their tails to create a spawning bed (or redd) in gravelly areas.  Redds may measure 1 - 2 feet in size.  Female brook trout can produce between 100 - 400 eggs depending upon the size and age of the individual.  After spawning the female covers the eggs with gravel.  Brook trout eggs must get continous amounts of oxygen in order for the eggs to survive.  Depending upon water temperatures the eggs will incubate 2 to 3 months before hatching into sac fry.  The sac fry remain in the redd until their yolk sac is absorbed.  Then, when they are about 1 Â½ inches long, they venture away from the redd to feed.  It takes about 2 to 3 years for them to mature and they usually do not live longer than 6 years.  Brook trout living in streams often reach sizes between 7-9 inches.  Great lake brook trout or coasters can attain larger sizes up to 25 inches and 10 pounds.  Brook trout have been described as voracious feeders with the potential to consume large numbers of zooplankton, crustaceans, worms, fish, terrestrial insects, and aquatic insects.  Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Diptera often make up a large component of their diet.  However, they will often feed on whatever is most readily available.  Brook trout are avidly sought after by sport anglers, for food as well as for the sport.  They can be caught by using various bait and lures including worms, crickets, grasshoppers, wet and dry flies, spoons, and spinners.

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Single dorsal fin, light colored spots on darker body, upper half of gill cover and entire cheek has scales. As predators, northern pike can have significant impact on their prey species. As with muskies, pike lurk in the cover of vegetation in the lake's clear, shallow, warm waters near shore, although they retreat somewhat deeper in midsummer.  Pike consume large numbers of smaller fish - about 90 percent of their diet - but seem willing to supplement their diet with any living creature their huge jaws can surround, including frogs, crayfish, waterfowl, rodents, and other small mammals. Their preferred food size is approximately one third to one half the size of the pike itself. Great Lakes pike spawn in the shallows in April or May, right after the ice leaves, and before muskies reproduce. As a result of their eating habits, young pike grow rapidly in both length and weight. Females become sexually mature at age three or four years, and males at two to three years. Beyond sexual maturity, pike continue to gain weight, although more slowly. Great Lakes pike have an average life span of 10 to 12 years. Pike eggs and new hatchlings (which stay inactive, attached to vegetation for their first few days of life) fall prey in large numbers to larger pike, perch, minnows, waterfowl, water mammals, and even some insects. Larger pike have two primary enemies - lampreys, and man. Spawning adult northern pike, exposing themselves recklessly in the shallows, are vulnerable to bears, dogs, and other large carnivores. Northern pike flesh excels in flavor, thus making them a doubly rewarding game fish. Since their skin has heavy pigmentation and an unappetizing mucous coating, most people skin them or scale them carefully.

Lake sturgeons have a large protrusible, suctorial mouth on the bottom side of the head with 4 barbels in front of the mouth and beneath the snout. Lake sturgeons have a single dorsal fin located far back near the caudal (tail) fin.  The tail is heterocercal with the upper lobe much larger than the rounded lower lobe.  Lake sturgeon have no simple scales, the body is covered by dermal denticles on tough skin.  Juvenile lake sturgeon are a sandy brown color with black blotches, while adults are olive-brown to grey with white underneath and lacking black blotches. Lake Sturgeons inhabit large river and lake systems primarily in the Mississippi River, Hudson Bay and Great Lakes basins.  It has and continues to represent an important biological component of the Great Lakes fish community.  By the early 1900's many populations of lake sturgeon throughout their range had been greatly reduced or extirpated as a result of overfishing, habitat loss, the construction of dams, and pollution.  Lake sturgeons are listed as a threatened species in Michigan and either threatened or endangered by 19 of the 20 states within its original range in the United States.  This ancient family of fishes has been recognized since the Upper Cretaceous period (136 million years ago), at a time when dinosaurs were at the height of their development.  Lake sturgeons have retained primitive internal structures such as a cartilaginous vertebrae and a notochord, instead of calcified bone as found in modern fish. Lake sturgeons are the only sturgeon species endemic to the Great Lakes basin and are the largest freshwater fish indigenous (native) to that system.  Lake sturgeon can be considered a nearshore, warmwater species with water temperature and depth preferences of low 50s to mid-60oF and 15-30 feet, respectively.  Lake sturgeons are benthivores, feeding on small invertebrates such as insect larvae, crayfish, snails, clams, and leeches that they find along the bottom. Life history characteristics of lake sturgeon are unique with respect to other Michigan fishes.  Sexual maturity in females is reached between 14 and 33 years, most often from 24-26 years; and, 12 to 17 years for males.  Female lake sturgeons spawn once every 3 to 7 years while males spawn every 1 to 4 years.  Spawning occurs on clean, gravel shoals and stream rapids from mid April to late May in preferred water temperatures of 55-64oF.  Female lake sturgeon may lay 4,000 to 7,000 eggs per pound of fish.  The typical life-span of lake sturgeon is 55 years for males and 80-100 years for females. The current state record for a legally harvested lake sturgeon is 193 pounds taken from Mullett Lake, Cheboygan County. Habitat selection by lake sturgeon varies widely throughout their range and environment that they inhabit.  Some adult lake sturgeons have been found to remain in a small territory during the summer months, while others have been observed long distances from their original capture site one year later.  Adult sturgeon are known to intermix in the Great Lakes during non-spawning periods, but habitually return to spawn in streams where they were born (homing behavior), often migrating long distances up rivers in the spring. After hatching, some young lake sturgeons have been observed to remain in their natal rivers for their first summer of life.

The yellow perch and walleye, members of the Percidae or perch family, are characterized by a dorsal fin, which is completely divided into a spiny and a separate soft-rayed portion. Both are important game fish in the Great Lakes area. Yellow perch have the distinction of being the most frequently caught game fish in Michigan. In addition their reputation as a tasty treat makes them a doubly valuable Great Lakes product. The gregarious perch travel in schools, generally preferring relatively shallow waters near shore. They are rarely taken from waters more than 30 feet deep, although in spring and fall they inhabit shallower areas than they do in the heat of the summer, they tend to travel shoreward each morning and evening to feed, while during the spring and fall they appear to feed throughout the day. At night they appear to rest on the bottom and refrain from feeding. Unlike many Great Lakes fish species, perch remain active all winter long under the ice in both shallow and deeper water, hence they provide the ice fisherman with much sport and many a meal. When given the choice, perch prefer a water temperature of 66-70 degrees F and some suggest they follow the 68 degree F water temperature levels in their seasonal movements. They inhabit all the Great Lakes, with greatest Michigan concentrations in Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, Saginaw Bay, the eastern end of the U.P. and southern Michigan. Adult perch dine primarily on immature insects, larger invertebrates, (crayfish, etc.) and the eggs and young of other fish, which they take both from open water and from the bottom. In turn, bass, walleye, and northern pike all prey on perch. Perch average adult length is 4-10 inches, with a weight of 4-10 ounces, although adult size is quite variable. Perch are prolific breeders, but growth and ultimate size depend on population density and habitat productivity. Crowding results in stunted offspring that may never exceed a length of six inches; thus, a controlled harvest program can benefit both the angler and the fish themselves. Male perch reach sexual maturity at about three years of age, females at four. Perch spawn in the spring, laying eggs in gelatinous strings over dense vegetation, roots, and fallen trees in the shallows. These spawning grounds provide some of the best perch fishing available. Great Lakes perch populations were severely crowded and reduced in the late 1960s by the alewife, but perch are adaptable, and have staged a comeback that shows us they are here to stay.

Atlantic salmon are known throughout the world to be an exciting sport fish. This native of the North Atlantic Ocean was introduced to the Great Lakes in 1972 when Michigan planted some 20,000 young Atlantic salmon in the Boyne and AuSable Rivers. Two strains have been planted to date, including a strain from Sweden that has been landlocked for thousands of years. Lake-run adults enter their parent streams to spawn, and each river or stream has a characteristic time when this happens.  The female chooses a gravel-bottomed riffle above or below a pool, and there she digs a nest, or redd. As she lays her eggs in this depression the male simultaneously releases sperm. Then the female pushes gravel back over the eggs. When spawning is finished the adults may rest in the river for a time and then return to the lake, or the male may remain in the river all winter. Some Atlantic salmon live to spawn more than once. Eggs hatch the following spring, usually in April, but the newly hatched young don't emerge from their gravel nest until May or June. At that stage of their development, they stay in the stream's fast water, eating and growing for two or three years until they are about six inches long. Then they move downriver to the lake, where they grow rapidly, often to a weight of three to six pounds in one year. Some return to their spawning grounds after this first year: others wait an extra year, growing to a weight of 6-15 pounds. The average adult lake-run Atlantic salmon weighs 8-10 pounds. In the spring, Atlantics prefer the upper, warmer layers of the lake near shore, but in summer they retreat to deeper, cooler water. Then as fall approaches they again come shoreward as they head toward their spawning stream and the cycle repeats. Salmon in the lake eat crustaceans, but especially seek out smelt, alewives, and any other available fish meal. While on their spawning run they do not feed, but will often strike aggressively at artificial flies. Young Atlantic salmon are prime food for eels, northern pike, other trout, and birds such as mergansers and kingfishers. Atlantic salmon in the Great Lakes are caught using the trolling methods for chinook and coho fishing.

Rainbow trout are native to the Pacific Ocean along North America and to rivers and other fresh waters of North America west of the Rocky Mountains. They are a popular game fish, and for this reason have been introduced all over the United States. Great lakes steelhead are usually found in waters less than 35 feet deep at temperatures of 58-62 degrees F.  They are often found near stream outlets, especially in spring and early summer. In the lake-dwelling part of their life cycle, they wander along the shoals eating plankton, minnows, surface and bottom insects and other aquatic life. Although they feed primarily in mid-depths, they do take surface insects, including fly fishermen's flies. Larger rainbows will eat other small fish if available. Great Lakes steelhead enter their spawning streams from late October to early May. At the present most spawning occurs in the spring, although more steelhead are beginning to spawn in fall. Spawning takes place in a bed of fine gravel, usually in a riffle above a pool. Steelhead don't necessarily die after this; they may live to reproduce for as many as five successive years. Most rainbow trout return home to spawn in the stream in which they were born or planted. Trout eggs hatch in four to seven weeks, depending on water temperature. Young trout may travel downstream to the lake in their first summer, or they may remain from one to three years in their home stream before migrating lakeward. Individual growth varies greatly even within the same population. Most Great lakes steelhead reach sexual maturity at age three to five years, ahead of females. A mature 16-inch fish living in the Great lakes may continue to grow throughout its life and could reach 36 inches in length and up to 20 pounds in weight. However, average adult size for steelhead in 9 to 10 pounds while life expectancy in the Great Lakes is six to eight years. Larger fish, fish-eating birds and mammals and sea lamprey are the steelhead's natural enemies. In turn, the steelhead finds itself competing with other salmon and trout, other predatory fishes and a variety of bottom feeders, for its food. It also competes with salmon and trout for spawning grounds. Steelhead are valiant fighters and their flesh is outstanding no matter how it is cooked. An unbeatable combination that makes them one of the most popular North American sport fish.",

Although coho do spawn in Great Lakes tributaries, present fish stocks are maintained mainly by fish culture and stocking. There simply aren't enough streams available to produce all the fish the Great Lakes can handle. Coho spawing runs up tributary rivers occur from early September to early October. Females excavate a nest in a tributary stream's gravel bed. Both adult die soon after spawning. The next spring the eggs hatch and the young remain in the gravel for 2-3 weeks. When they emerge (March to July), some migrate downriver almost immediatly. Most, however, wait a year or longer before descending to the lake.Once in the lake, they stay near shore for a few months, then seek deeper waters. Young coho eat greedily and grow rapidly. Most coho spend about 18 months in the lake, then return to their parent streams to spawn (at age three or four). As soon as they are large enough, young coho begin to eat smaller fish, mostly of other fish species. In the Great Lakes, larger coho feed on smelt and alewives. They compete primarily with steelhead for food. Coho are preyed upon by predatory fish and birds while they are small, and residual numbers of sea lampreys also take their toll of coho populations.

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics: Single dorsal fin, sucking mouth with no barbels, long cylindrical body. The white sucker has coarser scales, the longnose has fine scales, but visually, with only one in hand, they are difficult to distinguish. The Catostomidae, or sucker family, is closely allied with the minnow family. Suckers are soft-rayed fishes that possess a toothless, protractile mouth with distinctive thick lips. The longnose and white suckers are two of the most common representatives of this family in Michigan's Great Lakes. Both the white and the longnose sucker are bottom feeding fish and spend most of their time in shallow, warm waters. In bays, estuaries and tributary rivers, both species make their homes in holes and areas around windfalls or other underwater obstructions. However, longnose suckers have been found as deep as 600 feet in Lake Superior. Although white and longnose suckers both lay their eggs among pebble and gravel beds in lake and river shallows during the spring, longnose suckers spawn several days before white suckers. Sexual maturity arrives at five to nine years of age for the longnose while the white species matures at three to eight years. In addition, white sucker females grow faster, get larger and live longer than males. Maximum life expectancy for white suckers appears to be 17 years; it can be as long as 22-24 years for the longnose. Whites usually grow to be 12-20 inches long, while the longnoses grow to 15-25 inches. As youngsters under 12 inches in length, suckers are eaten by northern pike, muskellunge, bass, walleyes and burbot. Sucker fry are preyed on by Atlantic Salmon and fish-eating birds. Sea lampreys damage sucker populations in areas where lake trout are scarce. As bottom feeders, both species dine exclusively on aquatic plants, algae, and small invertebrate animals - especially worms and crustaceans. White suckers have been accused of consuming large quantities of eggs from more desirable fish species, but there is no conclusive evidence to support this contention. The longnose sucker is not a serious predator of fish eggs. Economically, suckers are at present a potentially valuable by underused sport fish. Their bony flesh has a fine, sweet flavor and is often fried in butter, smoked or used in soups and chowders. Commercially, it is often marketed under the name freshwater mullet.\" Commercial \"deboning\" machines have been developed",

    "latinname": "Morone chrysops",
    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins separated into higher spiny and lower soft-rayed portion, nine spines in first dorsal fin, longitudinal bars along its sides. The white bass is a freshwater member of the sea bass family, or Moronidae, a group that contains many commercial marine species such as the groupers and jew fish. The white bass resembles the sunfish family to which the black bass belong. However the dorsal fin is completely divided and the dorsal spinous portion is higher than in the sunfish family. The white bass occurs in Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Land Huron and Lake St. Clair. It is an important game fish, particularly in Lake Erie. White bass live in clear waters usually within 20 feet of the surface, where they school and feed by visual orientation. Most feeding occurs during early morning or late evening hours, and can be quite a spectacular sight. Angers have witnessed larger compact schools of white bass driving smaller prey fish to the surface, where the victim leap about in a vain attempt to avoid capture. They appear to be great wanderers, often traveling six to seven miles per day. Adult white bass swim in schools, often  separating into groups of one sex of the other prior to spawning. These schools will move into shoals in the lake to spawn at random in the spring. (May or early June). During spawning, the female indicates readiness by rising to the surface. Several males then rush in and crowd around her, and eggs and sperm drop to the bottom, unattended by either parent. Eggs hatch in two days, and the young grow rapidly on a diet of insects and insect larva, crustaceans, and small fish. As they grow they depend on a fish diet, especially yellow perch. Most become sexually mature at age three, while they average 10 to 11 inches in length. Average adult weight is 3/4 to 1 1/2 pounds. White Bass seldom live longer than seven years.

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins separated into a spiny and a soft-rayed portion, cloudy eye, white tips on anal and lower caudal fins, canine teeth. Walleye are the largest member of the perch family. They lack the distinctive vertical bar makings of the yellow perch and have fan-like canine teeth.  These battling fish are exciting to catch, delicious to eat and because they feed actively all winter, they provide a fine year-round sport fishery. In spring and fall walleyes congregate in shallow bay waters of the great Lakes, where they seek out rocky areas and submerged bars. During the bright part of the day they retreat in schools to the shade of deep waters or submerged objects. In the summer, walleyes range into cooler, deeper waters. They prefer a water temperature of 55 to 68 degrees F and are seldom found in waters deeper than 50 feet. Walleyes are greedy predators. They eat small bass, trout, pike, perch and sunfishes. Prime feeding times are early morning and evening. Although in turbid waters walleyes are active throughout the day. Walleyes often associate with yellow perch, smallmouth bass, northern pike and muskellunge. In April and May, walleyes spawn over rock shoals. Males mature at age two to four years, females at three to six years. The average walleye caught by anglers is three years old and weighs from one to three pounds. Northern pike and muskellunge prey heavily on walleyes, while yellow perch, smallmouth bass and lake whitefish compete with walleyes for food. A close relative and look-alike of the walleye, the sauger shares habitat and, to some extent food sources with walleyes. Sauger are more adaptable to turbid water than walleyes are. Like walleyes, they are sight feeders which shy away from intense light, so they are most active at dawn, dusk and on cloudy days. Immature saugers feed on plankton and aquatic insects, while adults prey on small fish, insects, crayfish and leeches.

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins with spinous and soft-rayed portions united, small mouth, long pointed pectoral fins, faint black spot on soft-rayed part of dorsal fin separates the bluegill from other sunfish, which lack this dorsal coloration. The sunfish family, or Centrarchidae, includes such popular panfish as bluegills, rock bass and large and smallmouth bass. The members of this family resemble the perch and sea bass families, but they differ in that the sinous and soft portions of the dorsal fin are united and confluent. The large mouth bass is an exception, with a deep notch between the front and rear parts of the dorsal fin. The Centrarchidae generally prefer warm water, and are nesting fishes. That is, the males scoop out a depression where one or more females deposit eggs. The males then fertilize and guard the eggs and the newly hatched young. The bluegill is a native to eastern and central North America, including the lower Great Lakes. This fish enjoys a well-deserved popularity with anglers. Many a young angler boasts the delicious bluegill as a first catch, while seasoned anglers using light tackle find it a valiant fighter. Bluegills favor warm waters (64 to 70 degrees F) with plenty of cover such as weed beds, submerged logs, or drop-offs. They usually stay in relatively shallow water, but as temperatures rise in the summer, large bluegills will head for deeper water. This fish also provides good winter sport since it remains active all winter long. The bluegill spawns in the shallows in the late spring or early summer when the water temperature reaches 65 degrees F. Males build nesting colonies in gravel, sand or mud and will guard the eggs and newly hatched fry until they reach the swimming stage. The young fry eat algae and zooplankton. As they grow larger, bluegills add small fish, aquatic insects and plant matter to their diet. The bluegill  feeds off the surface of the water the midwaters and the bottom, where it can be a serious competitor with other bottom feeding fish. The average adult bluegill is 6 to 8 inches long, although some reach 10 inches.  Sexual maturity occurs at 2 to 3 years for males and 3 to 4 years for females. Average life-span of these fish is 5 to 6 years. For more information on how and where to catch bluegill see our  Michigan Fish and How to Catch Them and Better Fishing Waters.",

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins including one adipose fin, long thin body with purple, pink and blue iridescent sides. This small slender member of the Osmeridae family closely resembles members of the trout/salmon family. The smelt is native to North America's Atlantic coast from New Jersey to Labrador, and also occur naturally as landlocked populations in some lakes of New England and eastern Canada. In 1912, smelt were planted in Crystal Lake, Michigan, and from there they made their way to Lake Michigan. Like salmon, lake-dwelling smelt ascend tributary streams to spawn over gravel beds. Spawning runs begin in the early spring (April), and extends for about three-week period.  Cool weather conditions may extend the season. Smelt spawn at night and usually return to the lake my morning. At this time of year people dip-net them from streams by the thousands. The rest of the year, smelt school in the lakes cool, dark waters. Since they are sensitive to temperature and especially to light, they keep to the mid-waters of the lake, and may descend to near bottom during bright daylight. A cool 45 degree F is their optimum water temperature. Smelt fry grow rapidly; in the Great Lakes most are mature by the end of two growing seasons, and nearly all will mature by the end of the third season. As with many other fish species, females grow faster and larger and live longer than males. Smelt grow to an average size of 7-8 inches in length in the Great Lakes. Like members of the trout/salmon family, smelt feed on other living animals. Their diet includes insects, insect larvae, other aquatic invertebrates, and other fish, including small smelt, sculpins, burbot, whitefish, and other small fish. In the Great Lakes a shrimp-like crustacean is also a principal food item. Fish that prey on smelt are coho salmon, burbot, trout, walleye, yellow perch and other smelt!

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins with spinous and soft-rayed portions united, body longer than deep, upper jaw doesn't extend past eye, bronze streaks in cheek. Both the smallmouth and the largemouth bass - the black bass of the sunfish family - are top game fish with lots of fight and fine-tasting flesh. The smallmouth bass derives its name from the fact that the rear end of the lower jaw does not extend past the eye, while that of a largemouth does. Smallmouth bass reside in Great Lakes bays where waters are cool and clear, and the bottom is rock or gravel. Ideal smallmouth habitat contains protective cover such as shoal rocks, talus slopes, and submerged logs. Their preferred water temperature is 68-70 degrees F, cooler than that of the largemouth bass. Spawning activity begins in the spring when water temperatures reach 60 degrees F or more. The male builds a nest in quiet water, usually near shore, or downstream from an obstruction that causes a break in the current. Since the male will guard the eggs and the newly hatched fry, the nest is never far from deep water, or cover, where he can retreat when frightened. The eggs, which are larger than those of the largemouth bass, hatch in 2 to 3 days. Then the newly hatched light-colored fry drop down into the bottom of the gravel nest for three or more days. By the time the fry work their way out of the gravel on the ninth or tenth day, they are very dark in color. Under the watchful eye of the male, they swim in a dense dark cloud over the nest for a few days, then begin to disperse. At first they fry eat microcrustaceans, but soon add insects and fish to their diet as they grow in size. Smallmouth bass mature at age three or four, and occasionally live to be 10 to 12 years old. The usual smallmouth seen by anglers is 8 to 15 inches long, and weighs less than three pounds.

Rock bass are native to fresh water in east-central North America. This heavy bodied member of the sunfish family can be readily distinguished from other similar species by the six spines in the anal fin (other typical sunfishes have only three anal fin spines). These fish are a commercial species in the Great Lakes and are also an important sport fish. They are lively fighters when hooked, and their flesh is firm and delectable. True to their name, rock bass live in rocky areas in the lake's shallows. Adults live in groups, often associating with smallmouth bass and other similar fish. Spawning takes place in late spring and when water temperatures reach 55 to 60 degrees F. Like other members of the sunfish family, the male digs a nest in the lake shallows, and guards it tenaciously. A spawning area may be heavily used with several nests very close together. As a result, males can become quite aggressive as they attempt to defend territory and attract and hold females. The male guards and fans the eggs, and later broods the young for a short time. Rock bass grow quickly and adults weigh an average of 4 to 8 ounces. An average length is six to eight inches although some rock bass reach 12 inches. Few rock bass live beyond 10 to 12 years. Large bass, northern pike, muskie, and perhaps walleyes prey on young rock bass. Rock bass compete with smallmouth bass for food. They eat aquatic insects, crayfish, and small fish, including their own young, yellow perch, and minnows. Rock bass occasionally take food from the surface.",

The menominee, or round whitefish, although unfamiliar to many anglers, is native to all the Great Lakes except Lake Erie. Few anglers have caught and eaten menominee, but those who do find them excellent eating. They are primarily a commercial species, similar to lake whitefish but somewhat smaller. A shy fish, it is rarely seen except when it ventures into shallow (6-48 foot deep) waters in April and May and again in October and November. The remainder of the year, it appears to range out to depths as great as 150 feet. Spawning occurs over gravel shoals in the fall of the year, usually November in the Great Lakes region. Neither the male nor female eats during pre-spawning periods. The males arrive at the spawning grounds first, and when the females arrive, they swim off in pairs rather than form a spawning school. Neither parent guards the fertilized eggs which hatch the following April. Young menominee grow quickly: adults reach a maximum size of about 22 inches in length and five pounds in weight. Their life-span probably doesn't exceed 12 or 13 years. Menominee are bottom feeders: they live on small clams, snails, insect larvae (especially mayfly) and fish eggs. They especially love lake trout eggs. Although not usually a major food for lake trout, lakers do prey to some extent on Menominees. Round whitefish eggs provide many a meal for burbot, bullheads, yellow perch and whitesuckers. Atlantic salmon consider young Menominee a delicacy.",

Another popular fish, the largemouth bass, lives in shallow water habitats, among reeds, waterlilies and other vegetation. It shares these habitats with muskies, northern pike, yellow perch and bullheads. Largemouth bass are adapted to warm waters of 80-82 degree F, and are seldom found deeper than 20 feet. They prefer clear waters with no noticeable current and do not tolerate excessive turbidity and siltation. In winter they dwell on or near the lake bottom, but stay fairly active throughout the season. Like the smallmouth bass, they spawn in late spring or early summer. The male constructs a nest on rocky or gravelly bottoms, although occasionally the eggs are deposited on leaves and rootlets of submerged vegetation. The eggs, which are smaller than those of the smallmouth bass, hatch in three to four days. The fry rise up out of the nest in five to eight days and form a tight school. This school feeds over the nest and later the nursery area while the male stands guard.  The school breaks up about a month after hatching when the fry are about one inch long. Largemouth bass eat minnows, carp, and practically any other available fish species including their own. Young largemouth fall prey to yellow perch, walleyes, northern pike, and muskies. Both largemouth and smallmouth bass are parasitized by the bass tapeworm, black spot and yellow grub. None are harmful to humans in cooked fish.

    "narrative": "Identifying characteristics:  Two dorsal fins including one adipose fin, blunt nose, fins clear or nearly so, greenish brown back, silver sides. Lake whitefish, a pale, shy member of the trout/salmon family Salmonidae, has long been a mainstay of the commercial catch in the Great Lakes because of its exceptional flavor, convenient size, and habit of schooling. Until recently, few sport anglers had discovered the special techniques required to catch lake whitefish, but this situation is changing, and any angler who has learned to fish whitefish successfully will find it well worth the effort. The reclusive lake whitefish prefers to swim in the company of a school of fellow whitefish in the gloomy, cool water of the Great Lakes at depths of up to 200 feet and deeper as summer's heat climbs, the main reason it requires extra skill to catch one. The whitefish spawns in early winter in shallow rock or sand bottomed lake waters less than 25 feet deep. The young hatch the following spring, and grow large enough to leave the protective shallows for deeper waters by early summer. Whitefish generally grow rapidly, but this varies by region and food supply. Lake whitefish can reach a size of more than 20 pounds and an age of over 25 years, although this was more commonplace 50 years ago. Although depletion of whitefish stocks by over-fishing and environmental deterioration had drastically reduced commercial yields, environmental cleanup and careful fishery management of the late 1960s has largely remedied this. Unlike its large-mouthed trout and salmon cousins, the lake whitefish has a small, exceedingly delicate mouth (another challenge for the angler) and it is therefore confined to dining on insects, freshwater shrimp, small fish and fish eggs, and bottom organisms. Most feeding takes place on or near lake-bottoms. Whitefish eggs are consumed by yellow perch, ciscoes, burbot, and even other whitefish. Young whitefish fall prey to lake trout, northern pike, burbot, walleye, and probably other fish-eating predators. Adults are taken primarily by man.
